  >The mural features names and portraits of community members who were pivotal
  to Sanctuary Farm's mission of food and nutrition access. Sanctuary Farm
  gardens are anchors connecting old and new residents, as well as volunteers
  who learn about the community's housing and economic development needs. The
  mural, which will be dedicated in June 2025, celebrates the community's
  multi-generational stewardship of the farm. It is a part of Mural Artsâ€™
  three-year commitment to co-creating new works of public art in Sharswood.</p
