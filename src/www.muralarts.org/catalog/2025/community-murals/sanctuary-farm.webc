    <p>The mural features names and portraits of community members who were
      pivotal to Sanctuary Farm's mission of food and nutrition access. Sanctuary
      Farm gardens are anchors connecting old and new residents, as well as
      volunteers who learn about the community's housing and economic
      development needs. The mural, which will be dedicated in June 2025,
      celebrates the community's multi-generational stewardship of the farm. It is
      a part of Mural Artsâ€™ three-year commitment to co-creating new works of
      public art in Sharswood.</p>
